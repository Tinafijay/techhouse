I mean, Look at this thing <img src="images/img-1767966055776-1.jpg" alt="photo of the Samsung Galaxy Zfold 7" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:12px;">. Samsung literally gave us exactly what we asked for like they literally upgraded the main camera sensor to the 200 megapixel sensors with seen on the S series smartphone since the S23, <img src="images/img-1767966063353-2.jpg" alt="a photo of the Samsung Galaxy Z fold 7 camera module" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:12px;">. There are many things to mention such as How thin the device actually is How large The Inner Display is and many more things.<p></p><p></p>The only thing that baffles me though is the price, I think that the default 7 for now is just a niche device for a lot of people, Because how can I spend rent money on a foldable device. But that is not to say it's a bad device though, It is really good in its regard.<p></p><p></p>Now let's talk about the defaultZ fold 8 8. I just want to talk about one specific thing, how Apple was supposed to be the ones to debut a screen that has no line that shows up when you fold it  display but then we saw Samsung literally showcasing the thing at CES this year, a very big slap to Apple . I mean 2026 is looking up to be a very good year for Samsung I've not even spoken about the trifold, let's leave that for next article . <p></p><p></p></body></html>
